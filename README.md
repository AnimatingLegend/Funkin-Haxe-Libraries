# Funkin-Haxe-Libraries

### What is this?
These are the haxe dependancies for (Funkin-Definitive-Edition)[]. Haxe 4.1.5 is offically outdated and doesn't work for compiling this engine anymore so I'm starting to merge into the current version of Haxe which is (4.3.6)[].

I updated the engine so it's now compatible with the current haxe version. this repo will undergo some changes/tweaks but for people having issues compiling the engine right now, download these dependancies and put them in your haxetoolkit. and everything should work.
