# Funkin-Haxe-Libraries

### What is this?
These are the haxe dependancies for [Funkin-Definitive-Edition](https://github.com/AnimatingLegend/Funkin-Definitive-Edition). 

If you want your game to successfully build without running into any errors, then I recommend you [download haxe 4.2.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/), as this is the only version thats compatible with my engine at the moment.

While these libraries are still subject to change, the game should be able to compile without any stops or bugs !!
